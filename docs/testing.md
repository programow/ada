# Testing

Vox Era's test pyramid has **four layers**, each with a clear contract about what it can and can't observe. This is per spec §9; the implementations live under `packages/desktop/`.

## The four layers

### 1. Rust unit tests (`cargo test --lib`)

**Where:** `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` blocks at the bottom of each Rust module.

**Scope:** pure logic, trait contracts, in-memory implementations of side-effecting traits.

Examples:

- `audio/mod.rs` — `PermissionState` (de)serialization round-trips.
- `secrets/mod.rs` — `InMemoryVault` get/set/delete semantics; `SecretKey::Debug` redaction.
- `audio/microphone.rs` — WAV encoding (`encode_wav_pcm16`) round-trip; session bookkeeping; peak-level reset on read; poisoned-mutex behaviour.
- `clipboard/mod.rs` — `InMemoryClipboard` read/write/overwrite + trait-object behaviour.
- `paste/mod.rs` — `RecordingPaster` records each call; `EnigoPaster` writes through to the trait object.
- `shortcut/parse.rs` — combo parser / formatter round-trips, case insensitivity, alias normalisation (Option/Alt, Cmd/Meta), function/arrow keys, exhaustive modifier combinations.
- `audio/permissions/mod.rs` — the platform module is wired up and returns *some* `PermissionState`. We deliberately do not assert which, because CI runners and dev machines differ.

History CRUD, retention, and stats live JS-side in `lib/db.ts` rather than in Rust (a divergence from Plan B). They are tested under the Vitest layer below — see `lib/db.test.ts` and the `__tests__/db-harness.ts` helper, which runs against an in-process `better-sqlite3` database with the migration SQL applied per test.

**What it does NOT do:** spin up a Tauri app, talk to the real keyring, talk to the real microphone, hit any network.

### 2. Vitest unit tests (`bun run test:unit`)

**Where:** `packages/desktop/src/**/*.test.ts(x)`, excluding `tests/integration/**` and `tests/functional/**`.

**Scope:** TypeScript pure functions, React components in isolation, the data-driven provider contract.

Examples:

- `lib/utils.test.ts`, `lib/invoke.test.ts`, `lib/invoke.contract.test.ts` — pure helpers and the `invoke` wrapper. `invoke.contract.test.ts` pins the TS wrapper signatures against the Rust command surface.
- `lib/markers.contract.test.ts` — parses `src-tauri/src/markers.rs` as text and asserts every `pub const NAME: &str = "VALUE";` has a matching named export in `lib/markers.ts` with an identical value. This is the load-bearing guard against Rust/TS drift on event names and error prefixes.
- `lib/db.test.ts` (≈32 KB) — covers api_keys, model_configs, transcription history, retention purges, app_state settings, and stats aggregations against `better-sqlite3`.
- `lib/recording-controller.test.ts` — the state-machine, with `vox.*` mocked.
- `providers/<id>.test.ts` — the contract test. Asserts presence in `PROVIDERS`, non-empty `defaultModels`, every default model has pricing, every pricing entry corresponds to a default model. For providers with `listModels`, also covers the request shape and a couple of error branches via `vi.fn()` mocking of `fetch`. `assemblyai.test.ts` additionally pins the `speech_model` → `speech_models` request-body rewrite.
- `windows/main/*.test.tsx` and `windows/overlay/*.test.tsx` — React Testing Library renders against happy-dom; user interactions via `@testing-library/user-event`.

**What it does NOT do:** make real network calls, touch a real Tauri app, exercise the Rust code path. `@tauri-apps/api/core`'s `invoke` is mocked.

### 3. Integration tests (`bun run test:integration`)

**Where:** `packages/desktop/tests/integration/**/*.test.ts`.

**Scope:** wire several modules together with mocks at the OS boundary.

This layer is reserved for cross-module flows that don't need a full app context but do need more than one module cooperating — e.g., a settings change rippling into a provider switch, exercised through the Vitest test runner with `MockMicrophoneSource` + `InMemoryVault`.

This layer is currently lean; expect it to grow as features land.

### 4. Functional tests (`bun run test:functional`)

**Where:** `packages/desktop/tests/functional/**/*.test.ts`.

**Scope:** the full transcribe flow, end to end, with the network mocked at the HTTP layer via [MSW v2](https://mswjs.io/).

The canonical example is `tests/functional/transcribe-flow.test.ts`:

1. Build a `Blob` from a committed audio fixture under `tests/fixtures/audio/`.
2. Mock `vox.getSecret` to return a fake key.
3. Stand up MSW handlers for the OpenAI transcription endpoint, returning a known `text`.
4. Call `transcribe(blob)` from `lib/transcribe.ts`.
5. Assert the returned text matches what the mock returned.

This layer is the load-bearing one for refactor safety: it pins down the contract between the webview, the providers, and `experimental_transcribe`.

## Mocking boundaries

The rule is: **mock at the trait boundary or the network boundary, never in between.**

- Rust: implement `Vault`, `AudioSource`, `Paster`, `ShortcutManager` with in-memory variants. Tests construct an `AppState` from the in-memory variants when they need the command surface.
- TypeScript: mock `@tauri-apps/api/core`'s `invoke` for unit tests; use MSW for HTTP. Don't mock `experimental_transcribe` itself — mock the HTTP it makes.
- Never mock React. Render with happy-dom + RTL; interact with user-event.

## Audio fixtures

Functional tests need real audio bytes. The committed fixtures under `packages/desktop/tests/fixtures/audio/` are deterministically synthesized via `tests/fixtures/audio/synth.ts` and `regenerate.ts`. Each fixture is a short WebM/PCM blob keyed by the test that uses it. To regenerate:

```bash
cd packages/desktop && bun run tests/fixtures/audio/regenerate.ts
```

The regeneration script is hermetic — it does not call the network and does not need a microphone. It writes deterministic samples (sine waves, silence, etc.) using `hound`-style WAV synthesis ported to TS.

Do not commit fixtures recorded from real microphones — they vary across hardware, embed environment noise, and don't replay deterministically.

## Coverage

Measured by `@vitest/coverage-v8` on the TS side; run with `/coverage`. The Rust crate is not measured by Vitest — use `cargo llvm-cov --lib` if you need a Rust coverage report (Plan B does not require one).

Coverage policy (per spec §9):

- Provider registry: 100% on the data-driven contract.
- `lib/transcribe.ts`: covered by the functional layer.
- React components: at least one render + interaction test per Settings tab.
- Rust trait impls: every public method exercised by at least one Rust unit test.

A missing-coverage failure is not a CI gate today — we surface the report and review it manually.

## When to write what

- **Pure logic** → Rust unit test or Vitest unit test, depending on which side it lives on.
- **Cross-module flow without OS dependencies** → Integration layer.
- **End-to-end transcribe-style flow** → Functional layer with MSW.
- **OS-level behavior** — `cpal` actually capturing audio, `keyring` actually writing the keychain — is exercised manually via `/dev-desktop` and `/build-clean`. There is no automated harness for OS-level behavior; that's a deliberate scope decision (the cost of CI runners with real mics + keychains exceeds the value at v1).
