# bluemacaw

Cross-platform speech-to-text desktop app. Press a global shortcut, dictate, get text pasted wherever your cursor is. Bring your own API key for any of 9 STT providers (OpenAI, Groq, Deepgram, AssemblyAI, ElevenLabs, Fal, Gladia, Azure OpenAI, Rev.ai).

**Status:** in active migration from a legacy Electron build. The new Tauri-based app lives under `packages/desktop/` (in development — see Plan B).

## Install

*Available once the first signed release ships (Plan D).* For now, see `docs/build-and-release.md` for local build instructions.

- **macOS:** [Download DMG](https://bluemacaw.com) (signed + notarized)
- **Windows:** [Download installer](https://bluemacaw.com) (unsigned at v1; SmartScreen warning expected)
- **Linux:** AppImage, deb, or rpm — see `docs/install-linux.md`

## Why bluemacaw

- **Bring your own key.** Your API keys live in your OS keychain. Audio goes only to the provider you chose. No bluemacaw backend.
- **Multi-provider.** Pick the model that fits: OpenAI Whisper, Groq's distil-whisper, Deepgram Nova, AssemblyAI, ElevenLabs Scribe, and more.
- **Cross-platform.** macOS, Windows, Linux. Same shortcut. Same UX.
- **Open source (Apache 2.0).** Read the code. Verify the privacy story.
