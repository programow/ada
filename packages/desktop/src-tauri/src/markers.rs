//! Shared string-based contracts between the Rust backend and the TypeScript
//! webview. These constants are the single source of truth — the mirror file
//! `packages/desktop/src/lib/markers.ts` re-exports the same values for the JS
//! side, and `lib/markers.contract.test.ts` mechanically asserts agreement.
//!
//! Two kinds of contract live here:
//!
//! - `ERR_*` — colon-terminated prefixes returned inside `Result<_, String>`
//!   from Tauri commands. The webview matches with `errMsg.includes(ERR_*)`,
//!   so the trailing `:` is part of the contract — the human-readable detail
//!   follows after the marker.
//! - `EVT_*` — Tauri event names emitted by Rust and listened-for by JS via
//!   `@tauri-apps/api/event::{listen,emit}`. Both sides import the constant
//!   instead of inlining the string.
//!
//! If you rename a constant here, rename it in `markers.ts` too — the
//! contract test parses this file as text and fails loudly on drift.
